## App Issues
Keep in mind that this application is made to be used in areas without internet connectivity. We designed it as meticulously as possible so it can save your data safely and upload it whenever you have a connection again. However, not every application is foolproof. If you run into problems where your data doesn't upload or record properly, or any other issues, let us know as soon as possible so we can investigate and fix it. We appreciate your feedback and want to make the app as resilient as possible with your help so you can have a great experience. Thank you!
